- **Job Search**
  - Best time to search
    - The best time to search for the job is when you already have it. Or if you are in college, then last semester is the best time to look out for the jobs.
    - Other time is when you see signs of upcoming layoffs.
    - Because once you are out of college or you have been laid off or have lost the job due to unforeseen circumstances, then it's tough by design to get the job. You'll be fighting against a timeline, you'll have hard time getting decent hike and so on.
  - How to get leads
    - Use your network well. Reach out to people via LinkedIn. Search and apply for jobs via various online platforms.
    - Take every shot, worst case you'll get rejected or people won't entertain you.
    - Try to maximize for your rejections, which will eventually lead to success.
  - Interview
    - Do not bluff or fake anything on your resume on in the interviews.
    - Be clear about what you know vs what you don't know.
    - One can use [S.T.A.R.](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) method for highlighting their past works/projects.
    - Interview yourself as strictly as possible, so that you don't get into any situation which you have not imagined by yourself.
  - Salary Negotiations
    - Know your bare-minimum price but ask way higher than that.
    - List out all the points supporting your ask, such as :- 
    - I am letting go my upcoming appraisal.
    - I can join early.
    - My current salary is way less than market standard.

- **Resignation**
  - **Retention vs Resignation**
    - Once you have the final offer letter, you can choose either to resign in the current organization or to ask your manager about retention.
    - Retention can help you stay in the same company with some higher package.
    - Be clear with your choice before talking to manager or HR about this.
  - **During Notice Period**
    - Once you have resigned, make sure you serve the complete notice period.
    - It helps you relax as workload will be lesser. Also, you'll be getting paid for un-applied privilege leaves in your full-and-final settlement.
    - But of course, choice of serving complete notice period depends on the individual.
    - Complete all the pending works and knowledge transfer on time.
    - Try not to spoil your relationship with people you have worked with.
    - Download all the pay slips and relevant documents before the last working day.
    - Leave gracefully.
    - Also, you can interview for more opportunities parallelly, given you already have one offer.
